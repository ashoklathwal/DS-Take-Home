## Note:

**Please don't contact me for the dataset.**

This repository is only for self-learning purpose. I am really happy if my solution is helpful to you. However, I won't provide the original book or the data files. If you want to do the exercise, you can go to [https://datamasked.com/](https://datamasked.com/) to purchase the book. Please respect the author of the original work.

1. [Conversion Rate](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/01.%20Conversion%20Rate.ipynb): One of the most common applications of data science: look at users coming to your site, predict who is going to convert and come up with ideas to improve conversion rate!
2. [Spanish Translation A/B Test](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/02.%20Spanish%20Translation%20AB%20Test.ipynb): In this challenge, you will check if an A/B test has been successful. Also, you will have to find out why results look counter-intuitive and design an algorithm to avoid that problem in future!
3. [Employee Retention](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/03.%20Employee%20Retention.ipynb): People data science! Can you predict when and why an employee is about to quit? This is one of the most recent, impactful and interesting applications of data science!
4. [Identifying Fraudulent Activities](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/04.%20Identifying%20Fraudulent%20Activities.ipynb): Any website transacting money has a team of data scientists, often called "risk team", to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. Build the model and design a personalized user experience based on the model output.
5. [Funnel Analysis](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/05.%20Funnel%20Analysis.ipynb): Look at how users use your site, where they click, and optimize user experience! Check click-through-rate for each page of your site and identify: what's broken, guess why and come up with ideas to improve conversion rate!
6. [Pricing Test](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/06.%20Pricing%20Test.ipynb): Optimize pricing on your site by looking at a pricing A/B test results! Can you improve revenue by offering different prices to different kinds of users?
7. [Marketing Email Campaign](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/07.%20Marketing%20Email%20Campaign.ipynb): Use Machine Learning to predict when to send a marketing email and what should be the email characteristics if you want to maximize the campaign effectiveness! Come up with ideas to personalize the email campaign so that different users get different emails!
8. [Song Challenge](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/08.%20Song%20Challenge.ipynb): Very early stage startups work with json files! You'll have to parse a json and build a song recommendation model in order to increase user engagement!
9. [Clustering Grocery Items](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/09.%20Clustering%20Grocery%20Items.ipynb): Look at user online purchases and try to automatically create categories based on what users are buying together!
10. [Credit Card Transactions](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/10.%20Credit%20Card%20Transactions.ipynb): Anomaly detection! Use unsupervised machine learning to identify credit card transactions that appear suspicious!
11. [User Referral Program](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/11.%20User%20Referral%20Program.ipynb): Sites offer you a reward if you send an invite to a new user and the new user uses the product. Let's find out with this challenge the impact of a referral program!
12. [Loan Granting](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/12.%20Loan%20Granting.ipynb): One of the hottest fintech topics here! We have data here about when a bank grants a loan. Try to beat their model and create a more efficient way to decide who should receive a loan!
13. [Json City Similarities](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/13.%20Json%20City%20Similarities.ipynb): Look at user browsing behavior on a hotel travel site and cluster them based on the browsing behavior. Can you predict in an unsupervised way who is going to book a hotel?
14. [Optimization of Employee Shuttle Stops](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/14.%20Optimization%20of%20Employee%20Shuttle%20Stops.ipynb): Using data to optimize the off-line world! Based on employee home address, optimize the best shuttle stop location!
15. [Diversity in the Workplace](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/15.%20Diversity%20in%20the%20Workplace.ipynb): Hot topic here! Look at data about employee salaries, title, and experience and figure out if the company is treating its employees fairly or there is some discrimination going on!
16. [URL Parsing Challenge](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/16.%20URL%20Parsing%20Challenge.ipynb): Learn how to parse a URL and suggest ways to improve a travel site search algorithm!
17. [Engagement Test](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/17.%20Engagement%20Test.ipynb): Another A/B test project. Look at test results and figure out whether engagement is going up! Also, figure out when an A/B test framework might fail!
18. [On-Line Video Challenge](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/18.%20On-Line%20Video%20Challenge.ipynb): Figure out which videos should be promoted on the home page in order to maximize revenue from ads! Can you identify the characteristics of "hot videos"? Is virality predictable??
19. [Subscription Retention Rate](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/19.%20Subscription%20Retention%20Rate.ipynb): Companies love subscription business models! Predict subscriber churn rate and come up with ideas to improve the company revenue via personalized offers!
20. [Ads Analysis](https://github.com/JifuZhao/DS-Take-Home/blob/master/20.%20Ads%20Analysis.ipynb): Another classical application of data science here! Can you optimize a company ads campaign? Which metric would you choose to identify the best ads?
